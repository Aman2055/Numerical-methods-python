# Numerical Methods Using Python

This project implements fundamental numerical methods using Python for solving non-linear equations and ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The aim of this project is to demonstrate numerical analysis concepts through practical coding and visualization.

## Methods Implemented

- Bisection Method for root finding
- Newton–Raphson Method for root finding
- Euler Method for solving first-order ODEs
- Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4) method for ODEs
- Graph plotting for function visualization

## Technologies Used
